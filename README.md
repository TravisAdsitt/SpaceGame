# SpaceGame
There is a vision to this game, I would like it to be with players who have fleets of ships. each ship can accept and perform a list of commands. Each ship needs oxygen(breathing) and hydrogen(rockets/power). Also the ships need to have communication with a base to be commandable from the user, so running out of hydrogen will render the ship not commandable.

I apologize for the coding this is a learning experience for me so the code may seem a little scatter brained in sections. If you want to help just message me or fork it! Thanks!

Also if you are on a Windows PC running it after download only requires going into the bin folder and running the .bat file in there.
